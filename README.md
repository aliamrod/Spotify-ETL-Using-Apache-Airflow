# Spotify-ETL-Using-Apache-Airflow
## Objective
Develop an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline utilizing Python and automate with Apache Airflow. In this project, the primary objective/problem statement calls for the need to use Spotify's API to read the data and perform basic transformations and data quality checks. Consequently, we load the retrieved data to PostgreSQL DB and then automate the entire process through Apache Airflow.
